# Thrust-Tester
Brushless motor and propeller thrust tester using Arduino
This simple device allows you to measure the thrust and efficiency of a motor and propeller combination, so choose the right arrangement of motor and propeller for your quad. The results ( %ESC drive, battery voltage, current, prop speed and thrust) are output to an SD card for plotting graphs with a spreadsheet. This is simple to build and costs very little, yet the results accurate. It uses the load cell and digital display from a cheap set of digital scales. All the parts can be easily obtained and are cheap to buy.
